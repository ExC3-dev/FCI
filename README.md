# FCI
This will let you forcefully inject scripts and book marklets becuase google blocked them on managed chrome books, so a lot of java script I like I cant run.

## Instructions
To use this you will need to load `chrome-extension://cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm/advanced-settings.html` and scroll down to the bottom and change unset to `...` then go to `chrome-extension://cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm/dashboard.html#1p-filters.html` and paste `*##+js(LLL.js)` now every thing is done.

> [!WARNING]
> If you mess anything up on these pages it wont work and maybe it could break Ublock if you edit anything else.

> [!TIP]
> If you do mess up you can go to home and then settings and click the reset setting.
